_Group 125's UCFunkit assignment for ENCE260._<br>



## About the Game

The Classic Game of Snap, be the first to hit your button when the numbers match, but don't get it wrong, or your opponent gets a point. Most points after the set number of rounds wins the game.

* Requires 2x UC Funkits to play

## Instructions

### Step 1:
- Have both funkits IR Senders and Recievers facing each other
- Power both funkits on (Plug into USB)

### Step 2:
- Each funkit will display the message "Choose Player"
- Choose a player to be player 1, the other person uses Nav switch up or down to switch to player 2
- Both players confirm selection by pressing Nav switch button

### Step 3:
- Screen will show the message "play Snap"
- both players click navswitch and the game is on

### Step 4:
- both players click the navswitch as much as needed (up to player)
- if both funkits display the same number, first person to hit the navswitch when the numbers are the same, wins the game, if you hit the navswitch when the numbers are different, you lose.
    
    - Be careful with 6 & 9, they appear the same at first glance ;-)
    
### Step 5:
- Funkits will display the winner and loser, then will revert to step 3 to play again.
